This is my first Node-based responsive single-page application that you can run upon executing npm start.
There are two options to run this application after pulling its image:
1) You can pull the image from this repository and open it in VS Code
2) You can fork the image under the branch "new_branch" and run it in your Codespaces environment with npm start
