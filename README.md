# 1. Filippo Zallocco's Portfolio
This is my first Node-based responsive single-page application about my background, skills, and projects.
There are two options to run this application:
1) You can pull the image from this repository and open it in an editor of your choice (VSC recommended), next type into the terminal "npm install" & "npm start".
2) You can fork the image under the branch "new_branch" and run it in your Codespaces environment with npm start

I update this repoistory quite often, and I am currently working on adding dedicated pages for academic and personal projects I built in the last two years.
