This is my first Node-based responsive single-page application that you can run upon executing "npm install" followed by "npm start".
There are two options to run this application:
1) You can pull the image from this repository and open it in VS Code, next type into the terminal "npm start"
2) You can fork the image under the branch "new_branch" and run it in your Codespaces environment with npm start
