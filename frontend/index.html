            <p>
            I am a Computer Science student at Pace University on track to complete my Master's program in May 2024, and I am seeking opportunities to use the latest and greatest technologies to solve business problems.
            Currently, I am currently a full-stack web developer intern with Sports.Excitement LLC, a startup based in Queens, NY, working on front-end and back-end code to support the launch and deployment of Velosaty, an app where student athletes find mentorship and career opportunities.
            <br><br>
            My journey in technology started all the way back in 2020 during my senior year in college. Classes like Intro to Python, Web Design, and Cybersecurity, gave me a 
            sufficient basis to understand certain technolgies. Shortly after my graduation, I accepted a role as a Business Development Representative with Micro Focus (now OpenText).
            During my tenure with the company, I studied the business' cybersecurity portfolio and developed rapport-building skills with C-suite managers across government, healthcare, & banking.
            It was not until I finished my sales training that I realized that my true passion is understanding how software works and the advancements it brings to society.
            Thus, I left the company and went on to study software engineering at the Seidenberg School in New York City.
