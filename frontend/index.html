            <p>
            I recently graduated from Pace University with a Master's degree in Computer Science, and I am seeking opportunities to use the latest and greatest technologies to solve business problems.
            Currently, I'm a full-stack intern at Sportsexcitement LLC, a startup based in Queens, NY, where I support the launch of Velosaty, an app that provides mentorship opportunities to student athletes.
            <br><br>
            My journey in technology started in 2020 during my senior year in college. Classes like Intro to Python, Web Design, and Cybersecurity sparked my curiosity for IT and software engineering.
            Shortly after my graduation, I accepted a role as a Business Development Representative with Micro Focus (now OpenText).
            During my tenure with the company, I studied the business' cybersecurity portfolio and developed rapport-building skills with C-suite managers across government, healthcare, & banking.
            It was not until I completed my sales training that I realized that my true passion is understanding how software works and the advancements it brings to society.
            Thus, I left the company and went on to study software engineering at the Seidenberg School in New York City.

          I created this website using Node.js, Express.js and by following Morten Rand-Hendriksen's JavaScript tutorials on LinkedIn Learning.
