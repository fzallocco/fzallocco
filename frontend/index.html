            <p>
            I am a graduate Computer Science student at Pace University completing my Master's program in May 2024, and I am seeking opportunities to make a meaningful impact.
            Currently, I am supporting the Black Boys Leadership Alliance as a Junior Application Developer (JAD), producing software to solve social issues in the NYC black and brown community.
            <br><br>
            My journey in technology started all the way back in 2020 during my senior year in college. Courses like Intro to Python, Web Design, and Cybersecurity, gave me a 
            sufficient basis to understand most technolgies. Shortly after graduation, I accepted a role as a Business Development Representative with Micro Focus (now OpenText).
            During my tenure with the company, I rigorously studied the company's product suite and developed rapport-building skills with c-suite managers across government, healthcare, & banking.
            I then realized that my true passion was understanding how software works and the advancements it brings to society. Thus, I decided to leave the company and pursue a Master's degree
            in software engineering in the US, leading me to the Seidenberg School in New York City.
